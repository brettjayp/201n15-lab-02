README - Brett Packard, Class 201n15, Lab 02, ABOUT ME

The objective of this lab, at this time, is to create an "About Me" webpage that has a "game" that meets certain grading criteria, using the knowledge we've learned so far and are capable of.

Some of the requirements that I think are key to focus on are as follows:
-At least 5 questions.
-Questions must be a mix of yes/no and user input questions.
-All yes/no questions must accept yes, no, y, and n, with any combination of type case.
-Need to create useful and descriptive output into console.log
-Must remember to follow ACP frequently.

Some initial brainstorming brings me to an idea, "Are we friends?", where the webpage asks a series of questions regarding the user's interests and personality traits, and in the end, it will tell the user if it thinks they would be friends with me. I think that the easiest way to do this at this point in my education is to ask several y/n questions such as "do you like X activity?" and find a way to tally the yes answers, and if they exceed a threshold, give a positive result to the user. It would be difficult at this time to factor complex answers, such as "what is your favorite TV show?", but those could be an excellent way to include details about the user in the final output, ie "I would love to watch 'fav tv show' with you", regardless if the outcome is positive or negative. While the interactions in the game revolve around the USER'S input, it would tie in to an "About Me" project because it would compare "About Me" with "About you", and I could creatively tie in comparisons to "About Me" in the final page output.
